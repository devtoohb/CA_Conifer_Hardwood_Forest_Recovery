Full rf-EVT 30m CA-wide rasters and data to run code in repo available at https://zenodo.org/records/14919626

*Exercise caution if using the finer EVT classes for these rasters, rasters were developed to leverage coarse EVT Phys classes and other crosswalks provided in the original LANDFIRE classification should be of sufficient granularity for most applications*
