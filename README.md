Full rf-EVT 30m CA-wide rasters and data to run code in repo available at https://zenodo.org/records/14919626

*Exercise caution if using the finer EVT classes for these rasters as there are many classes throughout the state*

*I strongly suggest using the EVT Phys or other coarser groupings instead, LANDFIRE EVT crosswalk table to go from EVT -> EVT Phys (or other crosswalks LANDFIRE provides) in linked zenodo repo.*
